# HTML-boilerplate

This first homework is mainly focusing on creating your first pull request.

Follow the instructions to submit the homework:

- If you haven't forked the repository yet:
  Fork this repository, then follow the steps below.
   
- If you already have the forked repository:
Sync the repository if there are changes in the upstream, then follow the steps below.

  
1. Create a new branch
2. Switch to the new branch
3. Create another folder with your GitHub username or regular name
4. Add the HTML boilerplate (try to create it by yourself)
5. Change the text in the title element
6. Add the modified file to the next stage (git add)
7. Make a commit (git commit -m "message")
8. Push the changes to your fork (git push origin your_branch_name)
9. Create a pull request
10. Wait for the feedback
11. If it gets approved then you did an excellent job, if not then I will request changes in the pull request (I will leave a comment) and then repeat the instructions from step 3
